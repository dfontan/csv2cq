CSV2CQ
======

A node.js script to convert a CSV file into CQ5 .content.xml files.

---

### Install ###

1. This script needs node.js, you can install it from here:  
   http://nodejs.org/#download

2. Install the following node.js packages: mkdirp, csv and mu2.  
   To do so, type the following into your command line:
    > npm install mkdirp  
    > npm install csv  
    > npm install mu2  

### Import ###

1. In Excel, export the file in CSV format.
2. Convert the exported CSV file to utf-8
   (eg. using Mac TextMate => Save As => utf-8).
3. In the command line, use node.js to run the cq-import.js script.
   Provide the required controller.js script as argument depending
   on which product structure you need for your CQ instance:
    > node import.js controller.js

This should have created a content folder with the whole product
structure underneath. Don't forget that the generated files are
named ".content.xml" and are thus hidden on UNIX systems.

### Implementation ###

This importer consists of 4 parts:

**import.js:**  
This script acts like a micro import framework that iterates over
a CSV file and for each line will call a mustache template to
render the output. It requires a controller.js script as argument,
for the import-specific information.

**controller.js:**  
This script acts like a controller in an MVC architecture: it
provides all import-specific information, like the CSV file to
import and a "transform" function that will be called for each CSV
row. This function allows to edit the data before the template is
rendered. It is important that for each row the following variables
are set:

* *importFile:* the name of the file that will contain the output of
  the rendered template.
* *importPath:* the path where to write the importFile.
* *importTemplate:* the mustache template to use to write the output.

**template.mustache.xml:**  
This is the View part of the MVC architecture. The template syntax
is explained here: http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html

**import.csv:**  
This is the Model: it contains all data. Before running the
import script, make sure that the CSV file is in UTF-8 format.
